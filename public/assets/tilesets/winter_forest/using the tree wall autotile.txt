This is an autotile that lets you use a terrain brush to paint the larger outer walls of your forest maps.

These tiles are each 128x128 pixels.
If your map editor can't handle that size tile, then you may not be able to use this in the intended way.

Examine the "tree wall autotile setup.png" image to see how the autotile should be setup in your map editor.
Each one is made up of an 8x8 tile "supertile".
The 16x16 subtiles were taken straight from the main forest tileset.

A version of the tree wall with only the leaves ("canopy only") is included to help you manage players going underneath the trees.
Place your own collision accordingly!
